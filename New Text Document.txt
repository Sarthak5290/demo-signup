I want to create new project.
In this project we have two folders 1. backend 2. frontend.
Now I want to create user signup, admin signup, user login and admin login and home pages according to user or login.
If user login we redirect user to user's home page and if admin login we redirect admin to admin's home page.
we are going to use mongodb, nodejs, becrypt and jwttoken for backend.
we are going to use reactjs for frontend.
I need complete guide to complete this project complete file structure to understand the project structure.




problem 
If I login as a admin and click on back arrow of browser it goes to the page of user 
but i want to stay it on admins page when i login useing admin and on users page when i login using user



i provide you the styling for signup and login page 
on the click on signup it switches to the signup page and vise versa
you can learn the code and give me my admin.js and login.js page
use tailwind only for the css (convert the simple css into tailwind for my project) 


use css and add trasaction effect when we click on signup page to go to signup page and 
when we click on login page to login page
